# Default Risk Modeling

## Problem
Develop a quantitative framework to analyze and interpret the probability
of default using financial and economic variables.

## Data
- Financial indicators relevant to credit risk
- Dataset prepared for academic analysis

## Methodology
- Exploratory data analysis
- Estimation of a default risk model using statistical techniques and ML models
- Interpretation of default probabilities and risk drivers

## Key Results
- Identification of key variables associated with default risk
- Estimated default probabilities under different conditions

## Financial Interpretation
The model provides insight into the factors driving credit risk and can
be used as a foundation for credit analysis and risk management decisions.
