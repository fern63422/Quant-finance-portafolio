# CAPM Regression and Market Risk Analysis

## Problem
Analyze the sensitivity of an asset's returns to market movements using the
Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

## Data
- Daily returns of market proxy (SPY)
- Asset returns (e.g., GLD or other traded asset)
- Data sourced from Yahoo Finance

## Methodology
- Alignment of asset and market returns
- Estimation of alpha and beta using ordinary least squares (OLS)
- Interpretation of regression coefficients
- Visualization of the fitted CAPM relationship

## Key Results
- Estimated beta indicates the degree of market exposure
- Alpha measures abnormal returns beyond market risk

## Financial Interpretation
A beta greater than one implies higher sensitivity to market movements,
while a beta close to zero suggests weak market dependence.
The CAPM framework provides a simple yet powerful tool to understand
systematic risk in asset returns.
